Employee Control System is a web application built using Rest API, DTO pattern,
Hibernate, Lombok, Swagger, and mapStruct. The app allows users to perform various CRUD
(Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a database. The DTO pattern is used to efficiently
transfer data between layers, while Hibernate simplifies the database operations. Swagger is
used for documentation, and mapStruct streamlines the mapping of DTOs. The tests cover both
unit and integration testing, ensuring the reliability and efficiency of the app
